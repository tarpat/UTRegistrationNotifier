## Tips and Tricks
* Use Chrome, as it works best on it!
* Open a tab in a new window with the page that contains the course
* You can shrink the window of the page to as small as you want and move it to a corner of the screen. This ensures that the program doesn't stop running from OS optimizations and energy saver settings
* Find "Always keep these sites active" from Chrome Settings and add the URL of the page with the class you want to add. This will ensure Chrome doesn't freeze or discard the page.
* Pin the tab, will also ensure the program keeps running
* Extend your screen on time when plugged in so the program can run even when you are not on it
* If you receive a notification of the course being open/waitlisted/open; reserved, then click on the notification to immediately go to the registration page to add it
* If you are plugged in, use the 5 second (min) refresh rate to almost instantly get notified. But if on battery, use 15 second+ refresh times as this program could drain quite a bit of battery
